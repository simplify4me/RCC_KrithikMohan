"""Integration test for the T25 main pipeline (capture -> segmentation/curb
-> obstacles -> decision -> serial -> watchdog), spanning the whole repo
rather than a single module -- hence its placement at the top level of
``tests/`` alongside the other cross-cutting suites.

Homography source
------------------
Uses the repo's real ``config/homography.yaml`` (loaded via
``rccar.calibration.homography_api.load_homography``) rather than
constructing a synthetic ``H_TRUE`` matrix like
``tests/calibration/test_homography_api.py`` does. It already exists, is a
valid 3x3 homography, and this test only needs *some* valid ground-plane
mapping to exercise the full pipeline end-to-end -- it doesn't assert on
specific real-world distances/offsets, so there's no need to hand-derive a
matrix with known image<->ground correspondences.

Serial client
-------------
A real serial port is never opened. A tiny ``FakeSerialClient`` fake (not a
``MagicMock``, for a stronger contract-check: its ``.write()`` validates it
was actually handed protocol-encoded bytes) stands in for
``rccar.serial_client.client.SerialClient`` and is passed directly to
``Watchdog``/``run_pipeline``.

Cases
-----
- happy: a short synthetic video (varying solid-color frames, same
  ``cv2.VideoWriter`` technique as ``tests/capture/test_source.py``) is run
  end-to-end through ``run_pipeline``. Confirms no crash and that every
  frame's result dict has non-None ``speed``/``steer``/``curb_state``, and
  that a valid protocol message was sent for every frame.
- edge: a synthetic clip of frames that are all the exact same flat color
  (no edges at all -> ``detect_curb_side`` returns ``("none", 0.0)`` on
  every frame) is run through the pipeline. Confirms steering falls back to
  0 on every frame (no curb to track), while speed is driven purely by
  obstacle distance (no obstacles on a blank frame -> distance is None ->
  speed stays FULL) -- i.e. losing the curb never forces a STOP by itself.
