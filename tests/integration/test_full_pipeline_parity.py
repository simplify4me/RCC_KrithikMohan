"""Code-path parity re-check (T28) on the FULL wired pipeline.

``tests/capture/test_parity.py`` (T5) proved that ``VideoFileSource`` vs.
``LiveCameraSource`` (monkeypatched to open the same underlying file)
produce an identical sequence of raw frames, exercised through a trivial
stub ``process_frame``. That's necessary but not sufficient: it only proves
parity at the capture layer.

This test re-runs the same idea against the FULL wired pipeline from T25
(``rccar.main.run_pipeline`` / ``process_frame``), all the way through
decision output (speed/steer) and the encoded serial bytes actually written
to the wire. It confirms that swapping the frame source implementation
(live vs. file) never leaks into the pipeline's behavior when the
underlying frames are identical -- i.e. ``process_frame``/``run_pipeline``
depend only on the frames and the (per-run, fresh) ``PipelineState``/
``Watchdog``/serial client they're given, never on which ``FrameSource``
subclass produced those frames.

Cases
-----
- happy: the same synthetic video, run once through a plain
  ``VideoFileSource`` and once through a ``LiveCameraSource`` monkeypatched
  (same technique as T5's ``test_parity.py``) to transparently open that
  same file, produces byte-for-byte identical serial writes and equal
  (exact for discrete fields, tolerance for float fields) per-frame result
  dicts.
