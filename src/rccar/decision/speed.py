"""Speed-tier decision from nearest-obstacle distance (T18).

Maps a nearest-obstacle real-world distance (cm), as produced by
``rccar.obstacles.distance.nearest_obstacle_real_distance``, to a
:class:`~rccar.serial_client.protocol.SpeedTier` the car should drive at,
using two tunable thresholds loaded from ``config/thresholds.yaml`` rather
than hardcoded magic numbers.

Boundary behavior (both comparisons are strict ``<``, see
``decide_speed_tier`` below):

* At exactly ``distance_cm == stop_distance_cm``: NOT STOP. ``stop_distance_cm``
  is not ``< stop_distance_cm``, so the value falls through to the SLOW
  check -> ``SpeedTier.SLOW`` wins at this boundary.
* At exactly ``distance_cm == slow_distance_cm``: NOT SLOW. ``slow_distance_cm``
  is not ``< slow_distance_cm``, so the value falls through to the default
  -> ``SpeedTier.FULL`` wins at this boundary.

In other words, each threshold belongs to the *safer/faster* side that is
adjacent to it going outward: the stop boundary itself is already outside
"emergency stop" territory (SLOW), and the slow boundary itself is already
outside "be careful" territory (FULL).
