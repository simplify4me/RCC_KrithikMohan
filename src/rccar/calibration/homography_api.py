"""High-level pixel-to-ground-plane distance API (T15).

This module wraps the low-level homography math in
``rccar.calibration.homography`` with the conveniences needed by
obstacle-detection code:

- loading a homography matrix from the YAML config format described
  in ``config/homography.yaml.example``,
- mapping a single image point to ground-plane cm with a "horizon
  guard" that rejects points that can't plausibly be on the ground
  plane (e.g. sky/background above the camera's horizon line), and
- reducing a list of obstacle centroids to the single nearest
  real-world distance.
