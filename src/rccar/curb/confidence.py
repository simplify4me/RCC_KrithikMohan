"""Curb confidence tracker: smooths ``detect_curb_side`` output over time.

``detect_curb_side`` (see :mod:`rccar.curb.detect`) is a per-frame
detector -- it can flicker frame to frame (a momentary occlusion, a shadow,
a bad Hough vote) even when a real curb is present. :class:`CurbConfidenceTracker`
turns that noisy per-frame signal into a stable, hysteresis-based state the
rest of the driving stack can act on: either "tracking" a curb side, or
"fallback" to lane-center driving when the curb has genuinely been lost.

State-machine rules (implemented exactly, see module tests)
-------------------------------------------------------------
* A frame counts as **found** iff ``side != "none"`` and
  ``confidence >= min_confidence``.
* The tracker keeps a running count of **consecutive** not-found frames.
* Starting in (or already in) ``"tracking"``: the tracker only flips to
  ``"fallback"`` once the consecutive not-found count reaches
  ``window_n + 1``. Fewer consecutive misses than that -- e.g. a single
  dropped frame -- do *not* cause a fallback; ``curb_available`` stays
  ``True`` and ``current_side`` keeps its last-known value throughout.
* Reappearance rule (chosen for simplicity, see task docstring): once in
  ``"fallback"``, the tracker flips back to ``"tracking"`` on the very
  next **found** frame -- there is no separate "confirm it's really back"
  delay. This is deliberately the simplest of the reasonable options; a
  system that wants more hysteresis on the way back in can wrap this
  tracker or require several found updates before acting on
  ``curb_available``.
* Before any frames have been seen, the tracker starts in ``"fallback"``
  with no side (nothing has been found yet, so there is nothing to track).
