"""Watchdog (T24): stale frame / processing stall / serial failure -> forced stop.

Three independent failure triggers all funnel into the same corrective
action -- attempt to send a STOP command to the MCU over the serial link:

  1. **Stale frame** -- no new frame has arrived within ``frame_timeout_ms``
     of the last :meth:`Watchdog.on_frame_received` call. Detected by
     :meth:`Watchdog.check_frame_staleness`, called periodically from the
     main loop.
  2. **Processing stall** -- the current loop iteration has been running
     longer than an allowed ``max_stall_ms``. Detected by
     :meth:`Watchdog.check_processing_stall`, a generic helper the caller
     drives with the timestamp its own iteration started at.
  3. **Serial write failure** -- a normal drive-command write raises
     ``SerialClientError``. :meth:`Watchdog.write_command` wraps
     ``serial_client.write`` and, on failure, makes a last-ditch attempt to
     send STOP via :meth:`Watchdog.send_stop` (which itself may also fail --
     that is tolerated, not re-raised).

All three paths funnel through :meth:`Watchdog.send_stop`, which never lets
a ``SerialClientError``/``ProtocolError`` escape -- the watchdog's job is to
*try* to stop the car and keep the process alive even if that attempt also
fails (e.g. the serial link is fully dead).

The clock is injectable (defaults to ``time.monotonic``) so tests can drive
the watchdog with a fully deterministic, mocked clock instead of sleeping in
real time.
